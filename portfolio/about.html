      <p> My name is Shayla Sexton! I was born and raised in Dallas Texas and I'm currently 20 years old. I will be
         a junior in the fall at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, NC. I am a
         Computer Science Student and this is my 2nd summer at Google!
         <br><br>
         I chose to study computer science because I have a passion for technology! My dream is to work in animation
         technology on the software side. I'm still not sure what that career looks like but I know I want to be apart of
         the production process. While I don't have any plans for graduate school, I wouldn't mind going for graphic
         design. Although I'm not incredibly artistic, I'm still so fascinated by the animation process and would love a
         career in that field!
         <br><br>
         My hobbies include Movies and Video Games, big surprise huh? I'm a huge nintendo fan, and recently hopped on the
         PS4 wagon. Some games I've been playing recently are Animal Crossing New Horizon, Splatoon 2, and Spiderman. Im
         not the best by any means, but it's always been a hobby of mine! As far as movies go, I just like to watch the
         good stuff! I watched the original Spiderman trilogy for the first time a couple of months ago and I see why
         People say it's superior to the others. I'm still debating, but Far From Home's Illusion sequence still amazes me
         to this day!
